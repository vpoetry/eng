I've made a mistake,
I had no choice, I had no way.
And now I'm trying to  love you again
Or maybe play.

I lay in the ashes of our lost love
Still trying to understand
What's wrong with the world where this can be denied 
And how it can be the end.

You know I've never been fighting for you
I won't let you feel all this pain.
And I've never lied so it shouldn't be hard
To believe in my feelings again.

So can you decide what you going to do?
I wait for your words on my knees.
Remember  your love is addiction of mine
I need it to  live and to breathe.
